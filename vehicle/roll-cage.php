        <p>Bridgestone World Solar Challenge is the worlds most well-known solar powered race car event. The regulation 
            for participating is rigorous with it's 60 pages rules. A major part of the contents in the regulation stipulates safety rules. 
            A big scrutinization is executed before the race and it takes almost 3 days to be cleared for the race. It is like a yearly swedish authority
             car inspection on stereoids in order to get to drive on Australian public roads.

            <p>Now we present one of the core parts of Viking. It’s not the brain or 
                an extravagant beautiful part, but it’s an important part. The role 
                cage is for the safety of our drivers. Works like a last shell if they
                 collide with something. Brigestone World Solar Chalenge 2019 
                 regulations were followed during the design process. </p>
            <img src="/images/carbon-fiber-producton.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Responsive image">  
            <p>The proses begun with a CAD model. With some work and calculations, 
                the process went forward. To get a grip on the real size of the model
                 a mockup was built whit the exact measurements. That’s also where 
                 they fitted the chair in the mockup to see if the calculations where
                  right.   </p>
            <img src="/images/Carbonfiber-Vaccum.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail right">
            <p>To estimate the strength of the roll cage a FEM-analyses where done to the
                 CAD model. (FEM-analyses ore Finite Element Method are a way to calculate 
                 with numerical methods in simulation firmware.) When the analysis where
                  done we got the design approved by a professional.    </p>

            <p>A big part of our material choice where made with weight and durability 
                in mind. The new material is lighter and with design changes a lot 
                lighter. The material used are called roll cage steel and are a lighter
                 but sturdy.   </p>
